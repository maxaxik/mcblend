Importing models This panel is used for importing bedrock models from JSON files. Usage Press the \"Import model\" button. Set the import properties on the right side of the file explorer. \"Geometry name\" lets you specify the name of the model that you want to import from the file. You can leave it blank to import the first model from the list. Don't add geometry. prefix to the model name (it's added automatically). \"Replace bones with empties\" checkbox decides whether the model should be imported using empties to represent Minecraft bones (checked) or an armature and bones (unchecked, default value). Find the model file in the file explorer and press import model to finalize the importing. The import model operator can also be accessed via File -> Import menu. Exporting models The \"Export models\" panel is used to export models. You can set the name and visible model bounds here. Exported model will automatically add the geometry. prefix to the name so you don't have to do that. Usage Select all of the objects that you want to export. Insert the name of the model. Press the \"Export model\" button. Choose the output path in the file explorer window. The export model operator can also be accessed via File -> Export menu. Exporting animations Exporting animations is done with \"Export bedrock animations\" panel. Usage Create new animation with \"New animation\" button (some of the parts of panel won't be visible until you have an animations). You may have as many animation settings saved as you want and you can switch between them with \"Select animation\" dropdown menu. Select the objects to export in the 3d viewport. Fill in the form with the information about the animation. Name - the name of the animation. Loop - whether the animation should be looped. Current frame only - instead of exporting animation exports the current frame as looped single frame pose animation. anim_time_update - the content of this textfield is copied to \"anim_time_update\" property of the Minecraft animtion. If you leave it blank the the animation won't use the anim_time_update. Press the \"Export animation\" button. Note The time of the animation is determined by the time of animation that you can set in the timeline. The animations should always start at frame 1. Frame 0 should have the model in the default pose. UV-mapping UV-mapping is performed via \"Set bedrock UVs\" panel. You can also use this panel for generating textures. Usage To perform the UV-mapping fill in the form and press the \"Set Minecraft UVs\" button. Texture width - the texture_width property of the Minecraft model. Texture height - the texture_height property of the Minecraft model. Allow texture expanding - whether the texture can be expanded if there is no space for UV-mapping. Generate Texture - whether the operator should generate a texture ( the name of the created texture is always \"template\") Template resolution - Sets the resolution of the template texture. This value describes how many pixels on the image is represented by one texture_widht or texture_height unit in the model definition. The value 1 gives the standard Minecraft texture resolution. Higher values can be used to create \"HD textures\". You can adjust the UV-mapping using UV-groups to get best. Note After the UV mapping, you can still go to the UV editor and move everything to your liking. This operator tries to arrange the UVs of the selected objects on the texture space using the basic non-per-face Minecraft UV-mapping. If you move the UV in such a way that it cannot be mapped in standard Minecraft UV-mapping way than mcblend will detect that and uses per-face UV mapping. Don't move individual vertices of the faces on the UV unless you know what you're doing. The faces on the UV must remain rectangles, or the UV of the exported model may have unexpected shapes. Modifying Mcblend properties The \"Operators\" panel gives access to operators that modify various properties used by Mcblend. Toggle mirror for UV mapping Toggles the mirror property of selected objects. The mirror property affects the process of UV-mapping. Objects with this property are mapped as if they had the Minecraft mirror property. Using this operator doesn't remap the UV. If you want to change the UV of the object, you must also use the operator from the Set bedrock UVs panel to update the UVs. Set the UV group Adds selected objects to one of the existing UV-groups . Clear the UV group Removes selected objects from UV-groups. Toggle export as bones Toggles the export bone property of selected objects. Objects with this property are always exported as bones. Mcblend usually tries to export most meshes as cubes and groups them together with some parent object that becomes a bone. If you want to mark a certain cube as an independent bone, you need to use this operator. Note The best way of using Mcblend is to have one rig for the model and parenting the meshes to bones of that rig. This allows you to take the advantage of features like inverse kinematics and also creates a model in which it's really easy to distinguish which Blender object becames what in Minecraft model. Bones will be translated into Minecraft bones and meshes into cubes. If you add some empties without children they will become the locators. Inflate Inflates the selected object using Minecraft inflate property. Running this operator opens a panel in the bottom left corner of the 3D viewport. You can use this panel to adjust the \"inflate\" value. Round dimensions Rounds the dimensions of the object in such way that they become integers in exported Minecraft model.","title":"Basic Operators"},{"location":"basic_operators/#basic-operators","text":"All of the basic operators are in the sidebar.","title":"Basic operators"},{"location":"basic_operators/#importing-models","text":"This panel is used for importing bedrock models from JSON files.

You cannot use other shapes in your model. Each cube in the model must be a separate mesh. The mesh must be exactly the same shape as its bounding box. If the model shape is different from the bounding box, Mcblend may fail on export, and if not, the exported model will only be an approximation of what you see in the viewport. Note The best way to avoid problems with invalid meshes is to always use the \"Object mode\" for editing the model and always scaling the cuboids in their local space. Additionally, you can enable drawing of an object boundary in: Object properties -> Viewport display -> Bounds No wide angles in animations There must be no more than 180\u00b0 rotation between two keyframes. This issue is caused by the way Mcblend computes Minecraft's rotations internally. Blender supports multiple rotation modes and uses different rotation types for different kinds of objects. For example, bone rotations in armatures use quaternions, but meshes use Euler angles. Additionally, users can choose different rotation modes for each object. Minecraft uses Euler angles, but the axes are set differently. Mcblend can export models and animations regardless of the rotation modes used, but internally everything is converted to quaternions / translation matrices. The design decision for the internal use of quaternions was motivated by the fact that quaternions help avoid some calculation errors. Unfortunately, the quaternion number system has only one unique representation for each rotation orientation, so one cannot distinguish full rotation from no rotation (360\u00b0 == 0\u00b0). Therefore, you cannot use angles greater than 180\u00b0 between two keyframes. Note A quick fix to this problem is adding additional keyframes for wide rotations.

Masks are filters that are applied to the texture when it is generated. Each UV-group has 6 faces. You can switch between faces to edit with \"Side:\" dropdown menu. The image below shows how the names of the sides (side1-6) are correlated to their placement on the texture. New masks are added with \"Add mask\" dropdown menu. There are 8 different types of masks. Note All masks have an eye icon in the upper right corner that can be used to temporarily disable / enable the mask. Color Palette Mask This mask takes the grayscale image as an input and maps its brightness values to a color image with a palette defined as a list of colors. Properties: Colors - list of colors in the palette Interpolate - whether there should be a smooth transition between the colors on the palette. Normalize - normalizes the input values so that the whole color palette is used. Note When input image is not grayscale than it gets converted to grayscale before applying the mask. Note Color palette mask is the only mask which can't be used inside the Mix Mask. If you put this mask into mix mask it will have no effect. Gradient Mask The Gradient mask creates a grayscale gradient with stripes of varying darkness and width. The direction in which the stripes are drawn is defined with two points on the texture. The grayscale image is than multiplied by the input image. Properties: Point A - the starting point of drawing gradient stripes. Point B - the end point of drawing gradient stripes. Relative boundaries - whether points A and B should be passed as absolute values (number of pixels from the lower left corner of the texture) or as a fraction of the texture size (0.0 lower left corner, 1.0 upper right corner). The absolute values can be negative, meaning they represent the number of pixels from the top right corner (starting at -1). Stripes - the list of stripes in the gradient their colors (strengths) and their widths. The widths define their placement on a line between points A and B so in most cases the width of the first stripe is 0, which means that this stripe should be drawn at the Point A. Exponent - the filter image is raised to the power of this value before it is multiplied by the image. Ellipse Mask Ellipse mask creates a grayscale image of ellipse that fits between Point A and Point B. The grayscale image is than multiplied by the input image. Properties: Point A and B - boundaries of the ellipse. Relative boundaries - whether points A and B should be passed as absolute values (number of pixels from the lower left corner of the texture) or as a fraction of the texture size (0.0 lower left corner, 1.0 upper right corner). The absolute values can be negative, meaning they represent the number of pixels from the top right corner (starting at -1). Exponent - the filter image is raised to the power of this value before it is multiplied by the image. Strength - the min and max values of brightness of created filter image. Hard edge - whether the ellipse should have hard edges or the brightness of the inner part of the ellipse should be smoothly interpolated to the edges of the image. Rectangle Mask Rectangle mask creates a grayscale image of rectangle between Point A and Point B. The grayscale image is than multiplied by the input image. Properties: Point A and B - opposite corners of the rectangle. Relative boundaries - whether points A and B should be passed as absolute values (number of pixels from the lower left corner of the texture) or as a fraction of the texture size (0.0 lower left corner, 1.0 upper right corner). The absolute values can be negative, meaning they represent the number of pixels from the top right corner (starting at -1). Exponent - the filter image is raised to the power of this value before it is multiplied by the image. Strength - the min and max values of brightness of created filter image. Hard edge - whether the rectangle should have hard edges or the brightness of the inner part of the rectangle should be smoothly interpolated to the edges of the image. Stripes Mask Rectangle mask creates a grayscale image with repeating stripes of certain width and brightness. The grayscale image is than multiplied by the input image. Properties: Relative boundaries - whether the width of the stripes is expressed as a fraction of the image width / height. Stripes - the list of the stripes, their width and their brightness. Horizontal - whether the stripes should be vertical or horizontal. Random Mask Random mask creates a grayscale image with randomly bright pixels. The grayscale image is than multiplied by the input image. Exponent - the filter image is raised to the power of this value before it is multiplied by the image. Strength - the min and max brightness values of the pixels on the filter image. Use seed - allows you to set the seed for the color randomization. Color Mask Color mask multiplies the input mask by a color. Mix Mask Mix mask lets you mix multiple masks in different way than just default multiplication. Properties: Exponent - the filter image is raised to the power of this value before it is multiplied by the image. Strength - the min and max values of the brightness of returned filter image. The filter image brightness values are mapped to fit on the scale between values defined with \"strength\" Mix mode - how to mix filter images produced by other masks. There are 4 options: min, max, mean and median. Number of children - Number of mixed masks.

Some of them are related to the addon and some of them explain some basics of using Blender which can be useful for working with Mcblend. Matching framerate By default blender uses 24FPS framerate. Minecraft uses seconds to define the timestamps of keyframes in animation. It's good to change the framerate setting into something that divides 1 second period into something nice - for example (25FPS or 20FPS). 1/24 is 0.0416666 but 1/25 is 0.04 which looks way better in the animation file. You can find the framerate setting in Output Properties -> Frame Rate . World unit scale By default 1 meter in your model is equal to one block in Minecraft. One meter in Minecraft model is 16 pixels on the texture of the model. You might want to measure the size in pixels instead of meters. You can change the setting that you can find under Scene properties -> Unit scale . Changing the value of this property to 16 will cause that one meter of your Blender model will be converted into 1 pixel in Minecraft. Creating materials Currently the addon doesn't create materials for your model during UV mapping and generating textures. When you create your UV map and texture template, it is not visible on your model. If you want to make the texture visible you have to create new material in shader editor and assign it to every object in your model. Generate texture template using the Set bedrock UV panel . Go to the shading tab and create new material. Based on the image below: Enable the transparency in material properties. Assign the material to other objects in your model. Select all of your objects and make sure that the object that uses your material is active. Go to Material Properties right click on the material and select \"Copy to selected\".","title":"Tips and tricks"},{"location":"tips_and_tricks/#tips-and-tricks","text":"This is a list of tips and tricks related to Mcbled.

The main purpose of UV-groups is to group cubes together so that they are mapped to the same spot on the texture. Using UV groups can help reduce the texture size when the model has many identical parts. UV-groups also let you can change the appearance of generated textures to your preference. This can be useful for setting some distinguishable look for UV-group members. You can create some fairly advanced textures with it, but it's usually better to create textures in a usual way. Future versions of Mcblend will allow you to export and import UV-group properties, making this feature more useful for texturing. Creating and removing UV-groups UV-groups are added / removed using the \"Mcblend UV groups\" panel from the Scene Properties with \"New UV group\" and \"Delete this UV group\" buttons.
